Updated & modified to work on the latest Azure Portal (June 2025)
=============================================

This extension has been updated to work on the latest Azure Portal as of June 2025. In addition, I've tweaked the output to show the number of resources against each resource group with colours. Green represents RG with less than 10 resources, orange for less than 40 resources and red for anything over 40.

Browse the RGs to view this:
https://portal.azure.com/#browse/resourcegroups

You can also enable the highlight resources tickbox setting:

Then, browse All Resources:
https://portal.azure.com/#browse/all

And you'll see the resources highlighted depending on if they're prod, nonprod or UAT/test, etc.
